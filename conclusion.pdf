This Movie Recommendation system can be useful for anyone who is looking for a movie 
suggestion based on their favorite movies. It can be especially useful for movie enthusiasts, 
people who are indecisive when it comes to choosing a movie to watch, or looking for new 
movie recommendations
The system uses a cosine similarity algorithm to find movies that are most similar to the user 
input. After analyzing the film attributes such as genre, cast, director, keywords and tagline, 
the system generates feature vectors for each film and then applies a cosine similarity 
algorithm to these feature vectors on to find movies that are most similar to the user .
This feature is intended to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on 
their preferences. It can save users the time and effort of watching new movies and allow 
them to see movies they might otherwise miss.
